# 1 Sinatra Restful Crud 
 
##Learning Competencies 

##Summary 

 ## Overview

Using Sinatra, create a simple notes application with a single notes table in the database and all [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) routes and views.  You can start from the standard [SInatra Skeleton ](http://cl.ly/2n3D2V0R0L2f ).

### Core
Demonstrate that you can implement CRUD in a Sinatra application.

### Objectives

Modify the skeleton code to achieve the following functionality:

1. A user Create a new note.  
2. A user can Read all the notes created.
3. A user can Update a note. 
4. A user can Delete an existing note. 
5. Verify that a user really wants to delete a particular note. 

Your note table should have a `title` and `content` field.  You should use RESTful routes for each operation. 


### You Will Know You Are Done When:
* You can Create, Read, Update and Delete a note.
* You use appropriate CRUD routes for each operation
* Your can describe how the routes and views interact. 

** Useful Resources:  
* [Sinatra Crud Tutorial ](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/singing-with-sinatra/) 
* [Rendering Partials in Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/faq.html#partials) 

### Stretch (OPTIONAL)
Add AJAX and Partials to convert your page to a single page application.

### Objectives

* Redo your application so that each CRUD route is triggered from an AJAX request.  When necessary, return a partial to update your display. 

### You Will Know You Are Done When:
* The above functionality is implemented with clean and efficient code in a single page application.
